## Dependencies 

* Node.js & npm


## Setup

1. Clone the repository to your machine.

2. Go to `./Catto/`, install the packages:
```
npm install
```

3. Compile Catto:
```
npx tsc
```

4. Fire up Catto!
```
node .
```

## Build into executable

In your console, type:
```
npm run build
```

## Configure

There are several configurations for Catto that you can change in `catto.config.js` if you want:

```js
module.exports = {
    // Current version to show in UCI
    version: "v0.7.0",
    // Late move reduction config
    lmrFullDepth: 4, // Number of moves to be searched in full depth
    lmrMaxReduction: 3, // Only apply LMR above this depth
    // Search extensions config
    maxExtensions: 2 // Seach extension limit
}
```

Note that the config file is compiled with the engine itself, so if you are using the built version, like `catto.exe`, creating a `catto.config.js` file will have no effect.
