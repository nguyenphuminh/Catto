## Dependencies 

* Node.js & npm


## Setup

1. Clone the repository to your machine.

2. Go to `./Catto/`, install the packages:
```
npm install
```

3. Compile Catto:
```
npx tsc
```

4. Fire up Catto!
```
node .
```

## Build into executable

In your console, type:
```
npm run build
```

## Configure

There are several configurations for Catto that you can change in `catto.config.js` if you want:

```js
module.exports = {
    // Search depth
    searchDepth: 5,
    // Set to true to turn on debug mode, will log out useful info
    debug: true,
    // If you disable stable mode, features that are in-dev and might cause issues will be turned on
    stable: true,
    // Leave true if you want UCI enabled, otherwise it will ask for a FEN string and log out the best position
    uci: true,
    // The starting position represented as a FEN string
    fen: "rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1",
    // Current version to show in UCI
    version: "v0.4.0",
    // Late move reduction config
    lmrFullDepth: 4, // Number of moves to be searched in full depth
    lmrMaxReduction: 3 // Only apply LMR above this depth
}
```


## What do we currently have?

### The engine

* Negamax search algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning.
* Move ordering:
    * MVV-LVA heuristic.
    * Killer heuristic.
    * History heuristic.
    * Countermove heuristic.
* Transposition table (disabled).
* Null-move pruning.
* Late move reductions.
* Checkmate and stalemate detection.
* Quiescence search.
* Evalution:
    * PeSTO evaluation.
    * Pawn structure.
* UCI.


## Todos

See todos for Catto [here](https://github.com/users/nguyenphuminh/projects/2).


## This looks familiar...

This used to be the Meow chess engine but I have decided to rebuilt it from the ground up because the old codebase is too messy and I lost track of what I was doing. Catto is written in Typescript and is designed to be more modular.
